# XGBoost-Regressor-Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction

=> This project involves analyzing sales data from a retail store and building a machine learning model to predict the outlet type. The dataset contains various product features and store-related attributes, which are utilized to draw insights and develop a predictive model.

=> Key Features
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values and encoded categorical data.
2. EDA: Visualized trends like product visibility, outlet size, and sales distribution.
3. ML Model: Used XGBoost Regressor for outlet type prediction.

=> Libraries Used
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost

=> Results
- Achieved reasonable accuracy in outlet type prediction.
- Gained insights into factors influencing sales.

=> Future Scope
- Test other algorithms (Random Forest, LightGBM).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Deploy the model with a web interface.

=> Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies.
- Run the notebook/script for analysis and prediction.
